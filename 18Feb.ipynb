    "'''Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "Ans.Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encourages modularity and code reuse: APIs enable developers to build upon existing functionality without reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "2.Simplifies development: By providing pre-built functions and methods, APIs simplify the development process and reduce the amount of code needed.\n",
    "3.Enhances interoperability: APIs enable different applications, systems, or services to work together seamlessly.\n",
    "4.Facilitates integration: APIs make it easier to integrate third-party services or components into your own application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Dependency on third-party providers: When relying on external APIs, you're dependent on the availability, performance, and reliability of those \n",
    "providers.\n",
    "2.Versioning and compatibility issues: Changes or updates to an API can break compatibility with existing applications.\n",
    "3.Security concerns: APIs can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly secured and authenticated.\n",
    "4.Lack of control: Using external APIs means you have limited control over the functionality and performance of the underlying services."

    "Ans.A Web API is a specific type of API that is designed to be used over the internet using standard web protocols such as HTTP. It enables \n",
    "communication between a client (such as a web browser or a mobile app) and a server that exposes the API. The key difference between API and Web API \n",
    "is that Web APIs are accessed using web protocols, whereas APIs can be used in various contexts beyond the web, such as desktop applications or \n",
    "embedded systems."

    "'''Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "Ans.REST:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.REST is an architectural style that uses a stateless, client-server communication model.\n",
    "2.It emphasizes using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.\n",

    "Ans.Differences between REST and SOAP:\n",

    "1.Communication Style: REST uses a stateless, lightweight approach based on standard HTTP methods, while SOAP relies on a more structured and\n",
    "formalized approach using XML-based messages.\n",
    "2.Data Format: REST commonly uses lightweight data formats such as JSON or XML, while SOAP exclusively uses XML for message exchange.\n",
    "3.Protocol: REST uses HTTP as its protocol for communication, while SOAP can use various protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, or JMS.\n",
    "4.Flexibility: REST offers more flexibility in terms of data formats, protocols, and can be used in a wide range of applications. SOAP, on the other\n",
    "hand, is more rigid and suitable for complex enterprise scenarios.\n",
    "5.Performance: REST is generally considered faster and more scalable compared to SOAP due to its simplicity and efficient use of HTTP."
